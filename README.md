# Paddy-disease-prediction
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to predict diseases in paddy plants using image data. The model classifies paddy leaf diseases into three categories: Bacterial Leaf Blight, Leaf Smut, and Brown Spot.

# Project Overview
This project aims to automate the identification of paddy leaf diseases, allowing farmers and agronomists to diagnose issues early and accurately. The model takes images of paddy leaves as input and predicts the disease from the three classes.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled images of paddy leaves affected by three diseases:

 1.Bacterial Leaf Blight
 2.Leaf Smut
 3.Brown Spot
